        <p>After decades of population growth and economic development, India is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases
             in the world. Not only is it now having a large impact on the climate, India is among the countries most vulnerable to 
             climate change due to its geography and dependence on agriculture. It has been estimated that if emissions are not 
             significantly reduced India could suffer economic losses of USD 35 trillion. Indeed, much of India experienced a heatwave 
             in April this year and in 2021 alone it experienced a number of extreme weather events: cyclones, a glacier collapse, heatwaves 
             and floods. Thus, India makes a thought-provoking case study for policymakers and risk professionals given the difficult 
             trade-offs that need to be made between the competing claims of climate mitigation, adaptation and economic development.</p>
